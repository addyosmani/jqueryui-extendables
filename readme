Current project status: active, not yet ready for consumption.

This is a semi-fork of jQueryUI with a number of components that I consider are missing from official releases. At present the aim is to include up-to-date versions of the following:

Select-menu (included)
Checkbox (included)
Textbox
Extended datepicker

This repo contains work built upon by other developers including the Filament Group, Felix Nagel and Craig Oshima.
